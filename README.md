## 🛠️ Projects
- **[Aki-TPU](https://github.com/Suijester/aki-tpu):** Parameterizable TPU-style matmul accelerator, implementing scalable systolic arrays for rapid calculations, ReLU unit for full neural network layer execution, and double buffering to conceal I/O write latency; achieved 176 MHZ with 90.6 GFLOPS for 16x16 matrix multiplication in simulation.
- **[RISC-V](https://github.com/Suijester/risc-v):** Lightweight pipelined RV32I soft-core implementation, featuring L1 Cache for instruction memory, static branch prediction, hazard handling, and register forwarding; achieved 100 MHz clock speed with 0.5ns positive slack, and <10% resource area usage when synthesized in Vivado on Artix-7.
- **[Aki-RTOS](https://github.com/Suijester/aki-rtos):** High-performance real-time operating system for STM32 Microcontrollers, implementing preemptive scheduling with semaphore-based blocking, priority-based interrupt handling, lightweight inter-task communication through message queues, and O(1) task scheduling with priority-ready lists; designed for embedded systems with limited resources.
- **[LZ77-Hardware](https://github.com/Suijester/lz77-hardware):** Low-latency parameterizable & parallelized search greedy compressor intended for FPGA deployment, achieving almost 2x compression on Alice in Wonderland, designed to trade-off between throughput and compression dependent on resource area.
- **[REST-Connect](https://github.com/Suijester/REST-Connect):** Middleman CLI Tool and API that enables automated test-case generation, enabling users in identifying logic, runtime, or behavioral errors through GPT integration.
- **[Memorize](https://github.com/Suijester/Memorize):** Memo assistant wake word speech-to-text tool that enables memo generation and storage in Postgres, enabling users to query prior memos via vector search, serving as a Second Brain for informational recall.

## ⚡ Fun fact

I love playing board games, but I almost never win if there's more than two players.
